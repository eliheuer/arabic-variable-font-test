This is my first attempt at making a variable font. It's currently just one glyph, Unicode 0628 "пе".

I started working on this after watching a [TypoLabs 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9xTa-qfR6o) on variable fonts.

The gif above was made with [Superpolator](http://superpolator.com/).
